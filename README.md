# Quadractic-Solver-Linear-Intersention
This program will ask the user for the a,b, and c of a quadratic and will return the vertex, y int, as well as the zeros. Additionally, it will ask the user for a linear function's m and b and it will return the points at which the parabola and the line will intersect.
